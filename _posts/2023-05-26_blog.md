## Neural Work

- Definition: <br>
A neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain. It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. 


## How do neural networks work?
The inspiration of neural networks architecture is from human brains, we call those neurons. It is a very complex and highly interconnected network, each neuron can communicate with each other by sending eledctrical signals. It is same for the neural network, but neural network is combined with software programs and algorithms.

## Simple neural network architecture:
The basic neural network has 3 layers:
- Input Layer <br>
The information from the outside world be accepted by this layer, and this layer would do some simple processing to the information.
- Hidden Layer <br>
The input of hidden layer is from the input layer. Normally, a neural layer has a large number of hidden layers, the hidden layer would analyze the output from the previous layer, processce it further and passes it to the next layer.
- Output Layer <br>
The output layer would provide all the final results of the data processing by the neural network.
